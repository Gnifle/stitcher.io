Hi! I usually don't write about the financial side of managing this blog and my newsletters; and yet, here we are. I must admit it feels a little awkward, so let's just get to the point first, I'll provide some backstory if you're interested in it as well. 

I work on stitcher.io and my newsletters solely in my free time. I used to have a large company sponsoring me for two years, but that partnership has ended. I'm now looking into other ways to get stitcher.io break even again; and one of the options is to try out Github sponsors. If you're a regular reader and if my content helps you, I kindly want to ask you to consider [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/brendt/).

Finally, if you're a company looking into dedicated ad placements on my blog or newsletters, you can [contact me via email](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io).

### Backstory

I've been working on stitcher.io as a hobby project for over 5 years now, and I've been enjoying it tremendously. In the beginning, stitcher.io was just a static blog that I hosted on a cheap $5 digital ocean droplet (in fact, my previous employer provided it for free, thanks [Spatie](https://spatie.be/)!).

Over time though, costs began to grow. I managed to get a long term sponsor contract, meaning I had a couple of hundred euros of extra income every month. It also meant I was now legally required to start a side business in my name, which of course increased my monthly costs: paying an accountant, social security fees, paying taxes on that newly created income, â€¦ 

I also started sending out a regular newsletter, meaning I had to upscale my cheap droplet, had to deal with mailing providers, etc. I managed to always break even thanks to that long term sponsor contract, but I always knew that if they decided to pull the plug, I'd have to search for other solutions. I am still running carbon ads, but honestly they earn too little to rely on: $50 a month on average.

So here we are: I've got a monthly cost of around 250 euros for hosting, mailing, accounting and software; which doesn't take into account any yearly or biyearly costs such as social security costs, taxes, domain names and of course all the time I spend on it.

Now, to be clear: I don't want to turn this blog into a profitable business. And I will keep working on it regardless on whether it's making any profit. Though, it would be nice being able to break even again. I also did consider other ways to finance this project, like for example by writing a new book; but I have to admit that my family situation right now (2 kids, third is on the way) doesn't permit such a time investment in something that I don't know will work.

So, long story short: stitcher.io right now is making a loss, I'm fine with it, but I would like to see it break even. I feel a bit awkward writing about it, but on the other hand: lots of other people do it, so I figure I'd give it a chance. If you benefit from my work and want to help out on a one-time or recurring basis, you can check out my [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/brendt/).
