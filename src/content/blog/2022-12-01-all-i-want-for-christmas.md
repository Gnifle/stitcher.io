Let's set aside all practical concerns for a moment — it's Christmas, after all. If you could choose — freely choose — what you'd want change in PHP; what would that be? 

Would you want generics or the pipe operator? Maybe you'd like to see consistent function signatures or get rid of the dollar sign. Type aliases, scalar objects, autoloading for namespaced functions, improved performance, stability — the list goes on.

But you can only choose one. What would it be?

I wouldn't pick anything from this list.

Let me tell you a story.
