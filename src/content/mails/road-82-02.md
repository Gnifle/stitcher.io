We'll avoid going down the rabbit hole of [type safety](/blog/liskov-and-type-safety) in this post, but technically `<hljs type>null</hljs>` and `<hljs type>false</hljs>` could be considered valid types on their own. Common examples are PHP's built-in functions, where `<hljs type>false</hljs>` is used as the return type for when an error occurs. For example in `<hljs prop>file_get_contents</hljs>`:

```php
<hljs prop>file_get_contents</hljs>(/* … */): <hljs type>string|false</hljs>
```

Note that using `<hljs type>false</hljs>` in a union type was already possible; but in PHP 8.2, it can be used as a standalone type as well:

```php
function alwaysFalse(): <hljs type>false</hljs>
{
    return false;
}
```

Many developers, including myself, are a bit wary looking at this RFC. It doesn't support `<hljs type>true</hljs>` as a standalone type, and shouldn't types represent categories instead of individual values? It turns out there is a concept called [a unit type](*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type) in type systems, which are types that only allow one value. But is it really useful, and does it encourage clean software design? Maybe, maybe not.

A standalone `<hljs type>null</hljs>` type makes a bit more sense: as `<hljs type>null</hljs>` can be considered a category on itself and not just a value within a category. Imagine the null object pattern:

```php
class Post 
{
    public function getAuthor(): ?string { /* … */ }
}

class NullPost extends Post
{
    public function getAuthor(): null { /* … */ }
}
```

It makes sense for `<hljs type>NullPost</hljs>::<hljs prop>getAuthor</hljs>()` to be able to say it will only ever return `<hljs type>null</hljs>`, instead of `<hljs type>null</hljs>` or `<hljs type>string</hljs>`, which previously wasn't possible to do.

Personally, I'd stay away from using `<hljs type>false</hljs>` as a standalone type for conveying error state — I think there are better solutions to solving such problems. I can see some use cases for `<hljs type>null</hljs>` as a standalone type and I'll probably use it sporadically.
