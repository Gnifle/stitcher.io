Here we are, arrived at the very last mail (you'll be unsubscribed from this list automatically).

Before we end though, I'd like to mention a few more smaller features and changes that come with PHP 8.1, in no particular order:

- There's a new `array_is_list` function that checks whether an array only contains ordered, numerical keys
- Class constants can be made final
- There's a new `fsync` function that forces synchronisation of file changes to disk
- There's a new explicit octal notation: you can use `0o` and `0O` to prefix octal numbers
- Passing null to non-nullable arguments in internal functions have been deprecated
- And several more small deprecations, you can check out [my list](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81) to have a full overview

Honestly, I'm very exited to start using PHP 8.1, it's a great release with tons of feature I've been wanting for a long time. What's your opinion? Make sure to hit the reply button on this email if you want to share your thoughts!
