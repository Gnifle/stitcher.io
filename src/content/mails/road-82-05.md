"Disjunctive Normal Form Types" â€” that's a mouthful. The RFC explains it like this: 

> Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) is a standard way of organizing boolean expressions

Still, it could use some explaining, don't you think? It's actually very simple: DNF types allow us to combine [union](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-8#union-types-rfc) and [intersection](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81#pure-intersection-types-rfc) types, following a strict rule. 

That rule is: when combining union and intersection types, intersection types must be grouped with brackets.

In practice, it looks something like this:

```php
function <hljs prop>generateSlug</hljs>((<hljs type>HasTitle</hljs>&<hljs type>HasId</hljs>)|<hljs type>null</hljs> $post) 
{
    if ($post === null) {
        return '';
    }

    return 
        <hljs prop>strtolower</hljs>($post-><hljs prop>getTitle</hljs>()) 
        . $post-><hljs prop>getId</hljs>();
}
```

In this case, `(<hljs type>HasTitle</hljs>&<hljs type>HasId</hljs>)|<hljs type>null</hljs>` is the DNF type.

By combining union and intersection types according to this one rule, you can create all possible boolean expressions (you can read [this post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form) if you want some background information on that).

It's a nice addition, especially since it means that we can now have nullable intersection types, which is probably the most important use case for this feature!

Until tomorrow!
