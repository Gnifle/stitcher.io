Something that has always bothered me about reading on the internet is how quickly you forget about great content. I might have read an awesomely inspiring blogpost last month, but chances are very slim I'll remember anything of it in a year.

Luckily, I have [Aggregate](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/) where I keep track of everything I've read (since I started the project), and so last week I wrote some code that will suggest "old but good posts" to me. It'll take some time to fine tune the system to my likings, but it's somewhat reassuring knowing I won't lose track of great content, and can re-read it from time to time.

You'll notice I'll share the odd "old" post from time to time in my roundups, I hope you enjoy them as well!
