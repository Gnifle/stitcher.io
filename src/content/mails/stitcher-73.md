Ok, so, I had lots of fun working on this project: I built a little game in PHP with Livewire, and I didn't to write a single line of JavaScript for it to work. My goal was to explore LiveWire, so building a little game seemed like a nice project.

I'm definitely not done yet. I know I've only scratched the surface of what LiveWire can do, so there'll be at least one more followup video. I also want to further explore the limitations of this approach â€” of course there are limitations as well.

Speaking of limitations, I also wanted to share a blog post I wrote last month. It's titled "[Limited by committee](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/40a6de1d-8390-4914-b539-b169acb519d6)". In it, I share some ideas about how PHP is designed, and how I think it has some major flaws. Will you let me know your thoughts?
