A common practice in any codebase is to send production errors to a service that keeps track of them, and will notify developers when something goes wrong. This practice often involves sending stack traces over the wire to a third party service. There are case however where those stack traces can include sensitive information such as environment variables, passwords or usernames.

PHP 8.2 allows you to mark such "sensitive parameters" with an attribute, so that you don't need to worry about them being listed in your stack traces when something goes wrong.
Here's an example from the RFC:

```php
function test(
    $foo,
    #[<hljs type>\SensitiveParameter</hljs>] $bar,
    $baz
) {
    throw new <hljs type>Exception</hljs>('Error');
}
 
<hljs prop>test</hljs>('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
 
<hljs error full>Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: Error in test.php:8
Stack trace:
#0 test.php(11): test('foo', <hljs yellow>Object(SensitiveParameterValue)</hljs>, 'baz')
#1 {main}
  thrown in test.php on line 8</hljs>
```
