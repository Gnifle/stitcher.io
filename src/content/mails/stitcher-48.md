It's been a while, hasn't it? I've got some pretty exciting news though! I've just released a new video, the start of a mini series [on YouTube](TODO).

In this series, we'll look at generics in PHP, why they aren't "a thing" yet, and what can be done in the future.

If you're not the video-type-of-person, you'll be happy to hear that you can also [listen to this series](TODO) in my Rant with Brent podcast, or you can just wait a couple of weeks, I'll post the transcripts on my blog as well.

But _do_ give it a chance on YouTube though: I'm trying hard to add some quality, PHP-related content over there, because I think it's lacking right now. I'd appreciate your support!

That's it for now, I'll keep you posted when the whole series has been published and when the textual versions are available.

Until next time!

Brent
