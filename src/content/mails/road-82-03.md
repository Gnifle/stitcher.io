As is common with minor releases, PHP 8.2 adds some deprecations. Deprecations often are a source of frustration, though it's important to realise they are actually very helpful. We'll come back to deprecations in general in a couple of days, but first we'll take a look at one deprecation in particular.

I'd say this deprecation — deprecated dynamic properties — is a change for the better, but it will hurt a little bit. In PHP 8.2 you'll get a deprecation warning when using dynamic properties, and you'll get an `<hljs type>ErrorException</hljs>` in PHP 9.0. 

But hold on, what are dynamic properties exactly? Well, they are properties that aren't present on a class' definition but are set on objects of those classes dynamically, at runtime:

```php
class Post
{
    public <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>;
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';

<hljs prop>var_dump</hljs>($post-><hljs prop>name</hljs>); // 'Name'
```

As of PHP 8.2, this part will be deprecated:

```php
// …

$post-><hljs striped>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

Now, don't worry: this deprecation won't affect any class that implements `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>`. These magic functions are an important part of PHP, and will keep working as intended:

```php
class Post
{
    private <hljs type>array</hljs> <hljs prop>$properties</hljs> = [];
    
    public function __set(<hljs type>string</hljs> $name, <hljs type>mixed</hljs> $value): void
    {
        $this-><hljs prop>properties</hljs>[$name] = $value;
    }
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

The same goes for objects of `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>`, they will keep supporting dynamic properties.

PHP used to be a very dynamic language, but has been moving away from that mindset for a while now. Personally I think it's a good thing to embrace stricter rules and rely on static analysis wherever possible, as I find it leads to writing better code.

I can imagine developers who relied on dynamic properties, who are less happy with this change. If you're in that group, you might find it useful to take a closer look into static analysis. You can check out my [Road to PHP: Static Analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static) series if you want to learn more!

And _just in case_ you don't want to deal with these warnings when upgrading to PHP 8.2, there's a couple things you can do.

You can use the `#[<hljs type>AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>]` attribute on classes that should still allow those properties:

```php
#[<hljs type>AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>]
class Post
{
    public <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>;
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name'; // All fine
```

Or you could simply disable deprecation warnings. I wouldn't recommend doing that, since you'll get in trouble with PHP 9.0, but here's how you can disable deprecation warnings in PHP anyway:

```php
<hljs prop>error_reporting</hljs>(<hljs prop>E_ALL</hljs> ^ <hljs prop>E_DEPRECATED</hljs>);
```

So, yes: this deprecation might be a little painful, but I believe it's for the best of the language to do so. And remember that it won't be a fatal error until PHP 9.0, so there's plenty of time to deal with it.

Until tomorrow!
