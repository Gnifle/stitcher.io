Speaking of dynamic properties: I'd say this is a change for the better, but it will hurt a little bit. Dynamic properties are deprecated in PHP 8.2, and will throw an `<hljs type>ErrorException</hljs>` in PHP 9.0. What are dynamic properties, you ask? Those are properties that aren't present on an object, but are set or get nevertheless:

```php
class Post
{
    public <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>;
}

// …

$post-><hljs striped>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

Keep in mind that classes implementing `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>` will still work as intended:

```php
class Post
{
    private <hljs type>array</hljs> <hljs prop>$properties</hljs> = [];
    
    public function __set(<hljs type>string</hljs> $name, <hljs type>mixed</hljs> $value): void
    {
        $this-><hljs prop>properties</hljs>[$name] = $value;
    }
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

The same goes for objects of `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>`, they will keep supporting dynamic properties.

PHP used to be a very dynamic language, but has been moving away from that mindset for a while now. Personally I think it's a good thing to embrace stricter rules and rely on static analysis wherever possible, as I think it allows developers to write better code.

Still, I can imagine developers who relied on dynamic properties not being happy with this change; maybe it would help to take a deeper look into the benefits of static analysis? You can check out my [Road to PHP: Static Analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static) series if you want to learn more!

And _just in case_ you don't want these warnings when upgrading to PHP 8.2, there's a couple things you can do.

You can use the `#[<hljs type>AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>]` attribute on classes that should still allow those properties:

```php
#[<hljs type>AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>]
class Post
{
    public <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>;
}

// …

$post->name = 'Name'; // All fine
```

Another option is to simply disable deprecation warnings. I wouldn't recommend doing that, since you'll get in trouble with PHP 9.0, but here's how you can disable deprecation warnings in PHP anyway:

```php
<hljs prop>error_reporting</hljs>(<hljs prop>E_ALL</hljs> ^ <hljs prop>E_DEPRECATED</hljs>);
```
