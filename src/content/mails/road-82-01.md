Thank you for joining the Road to PHP 8.2! Just as a reminder of what this series will look like: you'll receive one email every day for the coming days. Each day we'll highlight a new feature of PHP 8.2. Afterwards, you will be automatically removed from this mailing list — no annoying followup ever.

The only thing I will ask you at the end of this series, is to consider subscribing to my main mailing list, if you want to keep in touch. No pressure though: it's completely optional!

With that being said, let's take a look at what's new in PHP 8.2, and let's start with readonly classes!

Back in PHP 8.1, [readonly properties were introduced](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-readonly-properties). Readonly classes build on top of the same principle, but add syntactic sugar to make all class properties readonly at once. So instead of writing this:

```php
class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

You can now write this:

```php
<hljs keyword yellow>readonly</hljs> class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

Neat, right?

Functionally, making a class readonly is entirely the same as making every property readonly; but it will also prevent dynamic properties being added on a class:

```php
$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>(/* … */);

$post-><hljs striped>unknown</hljs> = 'wrong';

<hljs red full>Uncaught Error: Cannot create dynamic property Post::$unknown</hljs>
```

You might be wondering: when is this useful? I've been using a specific pattern for years, where I split data from functionality. On one hand I've got strongly typed data objects, while on the other hand I've got classes doing something _with_ those objects. I've called those objects **Data Transfer
Object** or **Data Objects** in the past, and called the classes that work
with them **Actions**.
