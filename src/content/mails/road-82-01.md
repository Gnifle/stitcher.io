Thank you for joining the Road to PHP 8.2! Let me give you a quick reminder of what this series will look like: you'll receive one email every day for the coming days. Each day we'll highlight a new feature of PHP 8.2. Afterwards, you will be automatically removed from this mailing list — no annoying followup ever.

The only thing I will ask you at the end of this series, is to consider subscribing to my main mailing list, if you want to keep in touch. No pressure, it's completely optional!

With that being said, let's take a look at what's new in PHP 8.2, and let's start with readonly classes!

---

Back in PHP 8.1, [readonly properties were introduced](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-readonly-properties). Readonly classes build on top of the same principle, but add syntactic sugar to make all class properties readonly at once. So instead of writing this:

```php
class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

You can now write this:

```php
<hljs keyword yellow>readonly</hljs> class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

Neat, right?

Functionally, making a class readonly is entirely the same as making every property readonly; apart from that it will also prevent dynamic properties being added on a class:

```php
$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>(/* … */);

$post-><hljs striped>unknown</hljs> = 'wrong';

<hljs red full>Uncaught Error: Cannot create dynamic property Post::$unknown</hljs>
```

You might be wondering: when are readonly classes useful? Well, I've been using a specific pattern for years, where I split data from functionality. On one hand I've got strongly typed data objects, while on the other hand I've got classes doing something _with_ those objects. I've called those objects **Data Transfer
Object** or **Data Objects** in the past, and called the classes that work
with them **Actions**.

The introduction of readonly classes simply take away so much boilerplate code. In fact, I made a little video about it to show you how much difference there is between making DTOs in PHP 5.6, all the way up to PHP 8.2:
