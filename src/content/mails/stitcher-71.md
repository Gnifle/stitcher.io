It's been exactly one month since I sent my last newsletter. There's of course a very good reason for this longer period of silence: our baby girl, Alina Lore Roose, was born! Despite it being a difficult pregnancy with several complications, Alina is doing great, and we're so happy and blessed to have her in our lives. 

I will keep taking things slow for the coming month though, as I'm only working a couple of days a week. But I am happy being able to send out this newsletter, because I've got quite a lot to share with you after a full month. Let's begin!

## Opinion-driven design

I did manage to make [one video](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/e8a560d6-d8d4-440e-a7a4-69b4ae0d375d) over the past month. This one is about how I favor "opinion driven design". I'm very curious what you think about the topic, but also how you like this story telling format. Will you reply with your thoughts?
