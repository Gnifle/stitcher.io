I've got some important news: today marked my last day working at Spatie and I'll start working at JetBrains in the PhpStorm team on Monday.

You're probably wondering what happened? I actually didn't plan on leaving Spatie originally, that is: I wasn't looking for a new job. Back in September 2021, though, I was told that the PhpStorm team was looking for a developer advocate/content manager; and this felt like an opportunity I couldn't pass.

If you'd ask me to describe my dream job, I would probably tell you it would focus on the PHP community, content creation and education; and this is everything my new job at JetBrains is focussed on. I don't think this comes as a surprise to anyone, so I think you'll understand why I made this decision. 

I'll of course miss my colleagues at Spatie — I spent almost 5 years with them — but I'm also ready and very exited about this new adventure; I'll keep you posted!

## What about my blog, videos and newsletter?

Nothing much will change in this regard: I'll keep working on my blog and other personal projects in my free time; but I will of course also be involved with content creation at JetBrains.

I'm also inspired to write another book, in my own name this time. That'll be a hobby project for the long run — I'll keep you posted on that.

## What about open source?

I've written quite a lot of open source code at Spatie, and I'm happy to help keep maintain it. It's actually an important part of my new job to keep programming, just to keep in touch with the language. So while I won't work any more on client projects like I used to, I will keep writing PHP.

I think I've said everything I needed to, don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you have any questions!

Oh, one more thing: if you followed along with the Generics in PHP videos, you'll be happy to hear that they are now also published as blog posts:
