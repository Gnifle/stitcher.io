Just keep calm. It's just a little bit of pain. 

I know how I said I was comfortable, but I've got to be honest, my legs are starting to feel a bit _uncomfortable_. 

I'm not sure if I can accurately describe it. It's an annoying, nagging, cramping kind of pain. It's the kind of pain that you could probably walk off. 

The problem isâ€¦ I can't walk it off. 

On one hand, it seems like the room I'm in isn't all that high, I definitely don't have the headroom to stand. I can raise my hands and touch the ceiling. On the other hand, I think I'm stuck, making walking even less possible.

I'm laying on my back, and somehow I can't move my legs. A couple of minutes ago I didn't even feel them, but now they are starting to ache. Let's assume that a good sign! I can feel my legs, so they are still there. 

Also, I think I heard some wailing sirens in the distance. It probably won't take long now before they get me out. A couple more minutes, and I'm out of here!

Ok that hurts! That hurts a lot! Oh, my leg, that's not a regular cramp!
