You know how, in the movies, they play that annoying, high-pitched tone after a bomb explodes or a gunshot is fired? 

Well, I didn't hear any tone. 

Granted, there was no explosion as far as I know, but still: a building collapsing must make quite a lot of noise as well, no?

At least, I _think_ the building collapsed, given that I was walking around the mall when the earthquake alarm went off. That's the last thing I remember. Now I'm here in the darkness.

It's surprisingly quiet. I guess someone will come and find me soon though. Best to stay calm, I'm not cold, I'm not in pain, so it's quite comfortable still. I'm the guy who people to keep his calm in stressful situations, so I'll keep my calm here as well.  

Ok that was loud! what was that sound? I hope the building doesn't further collapse. Just relax, I'm going to sing that song that Molly keeps singing all day long. Positive thoughts!

I hope Molly is fine though. No, I shouldn't stress: they do regular earthquake practices at school. So no need to worry. She'll be fine.
