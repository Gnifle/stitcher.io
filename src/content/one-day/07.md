I hate to admit it, but I'm not keeping my calm. Screw it. I've been here long enough and I want to get out. 

I've tried to move my leg, by the way. Not a good idea. The pain is back. 

Hold on, I should probably focus on my breathing, I'm starting to feel light-headed. 

That reminds me: is there enough oxygen here? There probably is. Don't worry about it.

Ok, hold on. You're not helping. Let's close my eyes â€” which doesn't really make a difference in the pitch black, but still. Let's think positive thoughts.

Molly. Remember how she was trampoline jumping the other day? That laugh! So adorable! It was such a perfect picture. The evening sun painting her almost gold. She's a golden girl. I would give everything to be with her now.

I hope she's alright.
