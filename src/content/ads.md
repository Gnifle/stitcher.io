Thank you for considering a sponsorship on stitcher.io! On this page, you'll find more information about stitcher.io, its reach and impact within the PHP community, as well as possible sponsorship options.

Stitcher.io is a well-known and trusted blog within the PHP community. Over the course of 7 years, it has gathered a loyal following, as well as a strong position for organic search traffic; resulting in, on average, **5.000 visitors per day**. I write about general PHP topics like my popular "[What's New series](/blog/new-in-php-83)", deep dives into PHP like recently where [I built a game with PHP](/blog/procedurally-generated-game-in-php), as well as opinion pieces like my recent "[Limited by Committee](/blog/limited-by-committee)".

Besides the blog, I also write the occasional newsletter, with more than **15.000 subscribers** and an **open rate of 30&thinsp;–&thinsp;35%**. I only send newsletters when I have something to say or share, which my audience seems to appreciate a lot: I never spam them with unnecessary content.

You can find more details about daily and monthly visitors on my [public analytics dashboard](https://analytics.stitcher.io/). If you want to reach out, don't hesitate to contact me at **[brendt@stitcher.io](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io)**.
