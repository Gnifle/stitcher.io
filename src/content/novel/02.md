"Watch out!" Tom's voice echoed through the air, his eyes wide opened as he witnessed the crackling white ball of energy hurtling towards June. Time seemed to slow as June's instincts kicked in. With lightning reflexes, she gracefully sidestepped, narrowly evading the magical spell hurtling in her direction.

Tom's target, a towering tree stump just two meters to the right of June, remained untouched; a silent witness to the near miss. However, the tree standing behind June wasn't as lucky.

"Tomas..." Master Jonan's voice cut through the tension, a blend of calmness tinged with underlying frustration. He let out a weary sigh.

"I can't help it, Master!" Tom's voice cracked with defiance. "It's the wind, I couldn't control it."

Master Jonan approached, his aging form straightening as he fixed Tom with a stern gaze, a concerned look in his eyes.

"Don't shift blame onto external forces," Master Jonan's words dripped with deliberate emphasis, his voice measured and serious. "You're the caster, you bear the responsibility of considering every factor, be it a windless day or the most tempestuous storm of your life." His voice resonated with authority. "You guide your spell to its intended target and nowhere else!"

"Yes, Master," Tom acknowledged, a twinge of realization settling in as he recognized the truth in Master Jonan's words.

"Now, let's switch roles," Master Jonan declared. "June, you shall take the lead, and Tom, I hope you’re as agile as June should the wind play its tricks on her as well."

Tom approached the original spot where June had stood, exchanging a knowing grin with her as they passed each other. He positioned himself half a meter from the aged tree stump, the true target. Ten meters away, June poised herself.

"Alright, June, you cast your spell. Tom, intercept it before it reaches its mark," Master Jonan commanded with a voice that was simultaneously forceful and composed, a faint glimmer of renewed confidence in June's abilities evident in his demeanor.

"When you're ready, June," Master Jonan gestured, taking a few steps back.

June inhaled deeply, her eyes sealed shut for an extended moment, lingering just a bit longer than a blink. As her eyes fluttered open, the tree stump came into razor-sharp focus. Her hands hung rigidly at her sides, tingling with the surging energy. She allowed a few seconds for the spell to take hold, gripping her hands with unwavering intensity. Then, with practiced fluidity, she lifted her hands in unison, her gaze fixated on the target.

The movements became second nature after countless hours of practice. Her hands ascended steadily, cradling the hand-sized orb of pulsating energy, feeling its weight.

Master Jonan observed June's spellcasting with a watchful eye. Precision and meticulousness defined her style. June's spell form was nearly perfect, a seamless sphere devoid of sparks. As she balanced it in a single hand, June exhibited far greater control than Tom in his previous attempt.

June drew another breath, poised to release her spell towards its designated target. She wouldn't need to throw it hard; the spell would gather speed as it soared, even growing in magnitude. Five seconds would pass before the spell met its mark. In their first year of spellcaster school, June and Tom had yet to master the art of casting truly formidable spells. The tree Tom inadvertently struck suffered damage but would undoubtedly survive its unintended brush with annihilation.

She threw.

With rapt attention, June tracked the trajectory of her spell — a flawless trajectory — aimed for the heart of the tree stump. She counted down in her mind: five, four, three... Abruptly, the spell froze mid-air, imploding upon itself until the ball of energy vanished with a soft, decisive pop.

June's lips curled into a triumphant smile as she turned to face Tom. He stood tall, arm outstretched toward the dissipated spell, his smile radiant.

"Well done," Master Jonan commended, his voice resonating with a mixture of pride and encouragement. "Again."

June's remarkable talent for spellcasting surfaced at the age of 13, during a heated discussion with her mother. In the heat of the argument, June inadvertently conjured a spell, its luminescent energy materializing as she voiced her frustrations. Neither June nor her mother could recall the exact details of the dispute, nor the words that triggered the manifestation. Nevertheless, the sudden illumination that bathed the room demanded their attention. Recognizing the significance of her daughter's display of magic, June's mother wasted no time. The following day, she sought the aid of Master Jonan, knocking earnestly upon his door. "You must help us. Last night, my daughter cast a spell!"

Hailing from a lineage of spellcasters — both her grandmother and aunt possessing the same gift — June's mother understood the importance of proper training. She was grateful for the presence of the venerable master residing within their village.

Master Jonan had settled in the village several years prior to June's birth. At the time, he was a man of 61, a seasoned veteran who sought respite after dedicating countless years to the tutelage of aspiring spellcasters and serving on the frontlines of various conflicts and campaigns.

For spellcasters, such destinies were often intertwined with the duty to protect their villages and towns. Occasional skirmishes erupted between rival clans, as neighboring communities banded together to form a united front. These clan armies, often no more than a dozen archers, swordsmen, and a select few spellcasters, occasionally boasted a handful of mounted riders.

However, there were moments when a common threat transcended the usual divisions among clans. Such occasions arose when towns and their inhabitants faced the menacing incursions of the elves from the North. Master Jonan himself had experienced the tumultuous clash against the elven forces in his youth, fighting alongside numerous fellow spellcasters. Yet, he remained reticent about those days, evading June and Tom's persistent inquiries. "Do not concern yourselves with tales of the past. Focus on what lies ahead," he would dismissively reply — an answer that left both June and Tom unsatisfied.

While June's journey into spellcasting began at the age of 13, Tom had stumbled upon his own abilities a few years earlier, when he was just 10. However, he had kept this secret to himself until he witnessed June's training sessions with Master Jonan in the open fields. "I can do that too, you know," Tom declared one day, after June had been honing her skills for several weeks.

Master Jonan regarded Tom with a mixture of surprise and skepticism. "Do what, exactly?" he inquired, curious to hear the young boy's claim.

"Magic," Tom replied, as if stating the obvious. Sensing the doubt in Master Jonan's expression, he felt compelled to prove himself. Tom attempted to cast a spell, though his technique left much to be desired.

The ball of energy he conjured flickered and sparkled in his hands, displaying a lack of control before abruptly dissipating with a resounding pop. Despite the less-than-impressive display, Master Jonan found himself utterly astounded by Tom's revelation.

Stammering to find his words, Master Jonan finally managed to inquire, "Why... When did you learn to spellcast, Tomas? And why have you kept it a secret from everyone?"

"It was about three years ago, sir, when I was ten," Tom explained. "I discovered it one day on my own. I never felt the need to tell anyone since there aren't many people close to me” — Tom’s parents passed away long ago. “I didn't think it mattered. Sometimes, I use my magic to keep warm during cold nights or rainy days, but other than that, I couldn't do much with it."

Master Jonan sighed, feeling a mixture of frustration and sympathy. "Firstly," he corrected, "it's not magic; it's spellcasting. A rare gift bestowed upon only a select few in this land. Secondly, you possess far greater potential than simply providing warmth or light, given the proper training."

Tom gazed at Master Jonan with a glimmer of hope in his eyes, yearning for the opportunity that had fueled his curiosity since observing June's training.

"Do you wish to be trained?" Master Jonan asked carefully.

"Yes, sir!" Tom exclaimed eagerly.

"And are you certain? This training is no trivial matter. You will spend several years here with me and June, and eventually, you may be sent to one of our neighboring towns to bolster the armies that defend our village. It is not an easy path," Master Jonan cautioned.

"Sir, I have been alone since I was a young boy. I have been blessed with friends who have taken care of me and shown me kindness, including June. However, I have always pondered what my purpose in life might be. I had no parents to teach me, no heritage to uphold."

Despite Tom's young age, his words resonated with a sense of maturity and responsibility that surprised Master Jonan. It was evident that Tom's years of solitude had instilled in him a profound sense of purpose whenever he set his mind to something.

Becoming a spellcaster had become that purpose for Tom. With unwavering determination, he continued, "So, yes, sir, this is what I want. I only realized the potential of my abilities when I saw June's training in these fields. Please, give me the chance."

Master Jonan found himself satisfied with the young boy's heartfelt response. "In that case," the old Master declared, his tone filled with a mix of resolve and approval, "you shall receive your training alongside June. I expect both of you to be here, ready for practice, one hour after sunrise each day from this point forward."

"I will be here, sir," Tom affirmed, his voice brimming with eagerness and determination.

Master Jonan offered a faint smile and added, "Oh, and Tomas, you may dispense with the 'sir.' From now on, you may address me as Master."

---

And thus, Tom embarked on his training journey alongside June. Despite his three-year head start in spellcasting — or rather, his attempts at it — it became evident that the few weeks under Master Jonan's guidance had propelled June far ahead in terms of skill and mastery.

However, June was more than willing to accommodate Tom's slower progress. They had known each other for years, long before the tragedy that befell Tom's parents, and a sense of friendship lingered between them. Though perhaps not the closest of friends, they had shared mischievous adventures throughout their youth, weaving their way through the streets of the village.

June couldn't help but wonder why Tom had grown more distant in recent years, isolating himself from her and the other children in the village. The loss of his parents had undoubtedly left a profound impact on the young boy, but his withdrawal seemed to coincide with the discovery of his spellcasting abilities. She hesitated to probe deeper into his seclusion, sensing his unease with the topic.

Despite these unanswered questions, June and Tom found solace and joy in their training sessions. It was as if their childhood friendship had rekindled, blossoming once more as they delved into the world of spellcasting.

Master Jonan dedicated himself to imparting the rudiments of spellcasting to his teenage apprentices. From casting spells with precision to directing them toward their intended targets, they learned the essential techniques. Defensive strategies were emphasized early on. A significant portion of their first year was spent honing their abilities to intercept, capture, and neutralize spells cast by others. As the year drew to a close, Master Jonan even took on the role of adversary, challenging June and Tom to halt the spells he unleashed upon them.

June and Tom couldn't help but be awestruck the first time they witnessed the might of Master Jonan's spells. Despite his advanced age, nearing 80 years old, Master Jonan displayed the same dexterity and power he had possessed when he began teaching young spellcasters four decades ago. His spells surpassed anything June and Tom had yet conjured, posing a formidable challenge to intercept and halt.

As their second year of training commenced, the focus shifted to developing secondary skills, including spellcasting while on horseback. 

Recognizing his own limitations, Master Jonan enlisted the assistance of the seasoned stablemaster, Duke, to guide them in this aspect of their training.

Little did Master Jonan or Duke know that June and Tom had already familiarized themselves with horseback riding during their previous escapades, which involved, let's say, "borrowing" a couple of horses from the stablemaster. They had stumbled upon a hidden entrance to the stables leading to the sprawling fields beyond. Under the cover of nightfall, when they knew Duke would be at home, they seized the opportunity for secret horse rides.

Neither Master Jonan nor the stablemaster were informed of their prior experience. Instead, both assumed that June and Tom were simply quick learners when it came to handling horses.

The third and fourth years of their training were marked by a relentless focus on strengthening their spells and enhancing their casting dexterity. These years proved to be arduous, with Master Jonan continually pushing his pupils to the limits of their abilities, only to challenge them further. Step by step, they made progress, steadily advancing toward becoming accomplished spellcasters. They were well aware that once the day arrived, they would be required to depart for the illustrious city of Arduina, where they would enlist in the armed forces of Arduina. For decades, the city had maintained a favorable relationship with their village, making it the most fitting clan to join.

As they looked ahead to the future, June and Tom knew they had one more year to complete before their journey would take them to the city of Arduina. This fifth and final year of training proved to be a pivotal stage, as Master Jonan introduced them to numerous principles of various spellcasting forms. Astonishment, as June and Tom realized that their previous  years of training had merely scratched the surface.

However, as Master Jonan imparted this knowledge, he also shared a bittersweet truth. "In Arduina," he explained, "you will need to seek out another teacher to continue your training. I am growing too old to guide you in mastering the more advanced skills of spellcasting. Nonetheless, it is crucial for you to have a broad understanding of the different forms, even if I can only provide you with a basic foundation."

And so, under Master Jonan's guidance, they delved into the realm of channeled and scattered spells, exploring the intricacies of chain casting, and familiarizing themselves with the applications of staves. Although their exposure to these forms remained at a rudimentary level, it became evident that Master Jonan's waning energy prevented him from delving deeper into their intricacies.

As their time with Master Jonan drew to a close, a sense of both anticipation and nostalgia filled the air. They had grown accustomed to his guidance and mentorship, and the realization that their training under his tutelage was coming to an end weighed upon their hearts.
