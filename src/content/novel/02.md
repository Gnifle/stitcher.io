"Watch out!" Tom's yelled, his eyes wide open as the crackling white ball of energy hurtling towards June. With lightning reflexes, she sidestepped, narrowly evading the magical spell Tom hurtled in her direction.

Tom's intended target, a towering tree stump just two meters to the right of June, remained untouched; a silent witness to the near miss. The tree near where June was standing, wasn't as lucky.

"Tomas..." Master Jonan let out a weary sigh.

"I can't help it, Master!" Tom's voice cracked. "It's the wind, I couldn't control it."

The aged master approached, his back straightened as he fixed Tom with a stern gaze. "Don't shift blame onto external forces," he said. "You're the caster, you bear the responsibility of considering every factor, be it a windless day or the most tempestuous storm of your life. You guide your spell to its intended target and nowhere else!"

"Yes, Master," Tom recognized the truth in Master Jonan's words.

"Now, let's switch roles," Master Jonan continued. "June, you take the lead — and Tom, I hope you’re as agile as June should the wind play its tricks on her as well."

Tom approached the spot where June had stood, grinning at her as they passed each other. He positioned himself half a meter from the aged tree stump. Ten meters away, June poised herself.

"Alright, June, you cast your spell. Tom, intercept it before it reaches its mark," Master Jonan commanded with more confidence in June's abilities.

"When you're ready," Master Jonan gestured, taking a few steps back.

June inhaled deeply, her eyes sealed shut for a moment, just a bit longer than a blink. Her eyes opened, and the tree stump came into razor-sharp focus. Her hands hung at her sides, tingling with the surging energy. She allowed a few seconds for the spell to take hold, gripping her hands. Then, with practiced fluidity, she lifted her hands in unison, and fixated on the target.

The movements became second nature after countless hours of practice. Her hands ascended steadily. She cradled the hand-sized orb of pulsating energy and felt its weight.

Master Jonan observed June's spellcasting carefully. Precision and meticulousness defined her style. June's spell form was nearly perfect, a seamless sphere with only small sparks. As she balanced the orb in a single hand, June had far greater control than Tom in his previous attempt.

June drew another breath, poised to release her spell towards its designated target. She wouldn't need to throw it hard; the spell would gather speed as it soared, even growing in size. Five seconds would pass before the spell met its mark — this was their first year of spellcaster training, so June and Tom had yet to master the art of casting truly formidable spells. The tree Tom inadvertently struck suffered damage, but would undoubtedly survive Tom's attack.

She threw.

June carefully tracked the almost flawless trajectory of her spell, it was flying straight to the heart of the tree stump. She counted down in her mind: five, four, three... Abruptly, the spell froze midair, slowly shrinking, until the ball of energy vanished with a soft, decisive pop.

June's face bore a triumphant smile as she turned to face Tom. He stood tall, arm outstretched toward the vanished spell, smiling as well.

"Well done," Master Jonan said proudly. "Again."

June's talent for spellcasting surfaced when she was thirteen, during a discussion with her mother. In the heat of the argument, June inadvertently conjured a spell, its energy lighting the room in a sudden flash. Neither June nor her mother recalled the details of their dispute, only what happened as a result of it. June's mother wasted no time: the following day she sought the help of Master Jonan, knocking on his door. "You must help us. Last night, my daughter cast a spell!"

Master Jonan had settled in the village several years prior to June's birth. At the time, he was 61, a veteran who sought respite after dedicating countless years teaching spellcasts, and serving on the frontlines of various conflicts before that.

For spellcasters, their destiny were often intertwined with the duty to protect their villages and towns. Occasional skirmishes erupted between rival clans, as neighboring communities banded together to form a united front. These clan armies weren't all that big, often no more than a dozen archers, swordsmen, and a select few spellcasters, with occasionally a handful of mounted riders.

There had been moments though when common threats transcended the usual divisions among clans. The elven wars a couple of decades ago, for example. Master Jonan had experienced the clash against the elven forces first hand, fighting alongside several clans that banded together. Yet, he remained reticent about those days, evading June and Tom's questions about it. "Do not concern yourselves with tales of the past. Focus on what lies ahead," he would reply — an answer that left both June and Tom unsatisfied.

While June's journey as a spellcaster began at the age of thirteen, Tom had stumbled upon his own abilities a couple of years earlier, when he was just ten. He had never told anyone though, until he witnessed June's training sessions with Master Jonan in the open fields. "I can do that too, you know," Tom mentioned one day, when June had been honing her skills for several weeks.

Master Jonan regarded Tom with a mixture of surprise and skepticism. "Do what, exactly?" he asked.

"Magic," Tom replied, as if stating the obvious. Sensing the doubt in Master Jonan's expression, he felt compelled to prove himself. 

Tom cast a spell, though his technique left much to be desired. The ball of energy flickered and sparkled in his hands, displaying a lack of control before abruptly dissipating with a resounding pop. Despite the less-than-impressive display, Master Jonan found himself astounded by Tom's revelation.

Trying to find his words, Master Jonan finally managed to ask, "When did you learn to spellcast, Tomas? And why didn't you tell anyone?"

"It was about three years ago, sir, when I was ten," Tom explained. "I discovered it one day on my own. I never felt the need to tell anyone because I simply had no one to tell." Tom’s parents had passed away long ago. "I didn't think it mattered. Sometimes, I use my magic to keep warm during cold nights or rainy days, but other than that, I couldn't do much with it."

Master Jonan, still surprised, continued. "Firstly," he corrected, "it's not magic; it's spellcasting. A rare gift bestowed upon only a few. Secondly, you possess far greater potential than providing warmth or light, given the proper training."

Tom gazed at Master Jonan with a glimmer of hope in his eyes, ever since witnessing June's training, he had hoped for an opportunity to be trained himself.

"Do you wish to be trained?" Master Jonan asked, seeing the hope in the young boy's eyes.

"Yes, sir!" Tom exclaimed eagerly.

"You should realise, this training is no trivial matter. You will spend several years with me and June, and eventually, you may be sent to one of our neighboring towns to bolster their armies. Are you certain?" Master Jonan asked.

"Sir, I've been alone since I was a young boy, never sure about my purpose. I had no parents to teach me, no heritage to uphold."

Despite Tom's age, his words resonated with a sense of maturity that surprised Master Jonan. 

Tom continued, "So, yes, sir, this is what I want. I only realized the potential of my abilities when I saw June's training in these fields. I would like to take that chance."

Master Jonan found himself satisfied with the young boy's heartfelt response. "In that case," the old Master declared, "you shall receive your training alongside June. I expect both of you to be here, ready for practice, one hour after sunrise each day from this point forward."

"I will be here, sir," Tom affirmed, his voice brimming with eagerness and determination.

Master Jonan offered a faint smile and added, "Oh, and Tomas, you may dispense with the 'sir.' From now on, you may address me as Master."

---

And so, Tom started his training alongside June. Despite his three-year head start in spellcasting — or rather, his attempts at it — it became evident that the few weeks under Master Jonan's guidance had propelled June far ahead in terms of skill and mastery. June however was more than willing to accommodate Tom's slower pace. 

June had known Tom for what felt like forever, and couldn't help but wonder why he had grown more distant in recent years, isolating himself from her and the other children in the village. The loss of his parents had undoubtedly left a profound impact on the young boy, but his withdrawal seemed to coincide with the discovery of his spellcasting abilities. She never pressed Tom on the topic though, she felt like he wouldn't want to talk about it.

Despite these unanswered questions, June and Tom found solace and joy in their training sessions. It was as if their childhood friendship had rekindled, blossoming once more as they trained and grew together.

Master Jonan dedicated himself to imparting the rudiments of spellcasting to his teenage apprentices. From casting spells with precision, to directing them toward their intended targets, they learned the essential techniques. Defensive strategies were emphasized early on as well: they learned to intercept, capture, and neutralize spells cast by others. As the year drew to a close, Master Jonan took on the role of adversary, challenging June and Tom to neutralize the spells he unleashed upon them. June and Tom were awestruck the first time they witnessed the might of Master Jonan's spells, despite his advanced age, nearing 80 years by now. His spells surpassed anything June and Tom had yet conjured, posing a formidable challenge.

As their second year of training began, their focus shifted to developing secondary skills, including spellcasting while on horseback. Recognizing his own limitations, Master Jonan enlisted the assistance of the seasoned stablemaster, Duke, to guide them in this aspect of their training. Little did Master Jonan or Duke know that June and Tom had already familiarized themselves with horseback riding. They had stumbled upon a hidden entrance to the stables leading to the fields beyond. Under the cover of nightfall, when they knew Duke would be at home, they seized the opportunity for secret horse rides several times. Neither Master Jonan nor the stablemaster knew of their previous experience. Instead, both assumed that June and Tom were quick learners when it came to handling horses.

The third and fourth years of their training were marked by a relentless focus on strengthening their spells and enhancing their casting dexterity. These years proved to be arduous, with Master Jonan pushing his pupils to the limits of their abilities, only to challenge them further. Step by step, they made progress. They were well aware that once the day arrived, they would be required to depart for the illustrious city of Arduina, where they would enlist in its army. For decades, the city had maintained a favorable relationship with their village, making it the most fitting clan to join.

This fifth and final year of training proved to be a pivotal stage, as Master Jonan introduced them to numerous principles of various spellcasting forms. June and Tom were astonished as they realized that their previous years of training had merely scratched the surface.

Under Master Jonan's guidance, they delved into the realm of channeled and scattered spells, exploring the intricacies of chain casting, and familiarizing themselves with the applications of staves. Although their exposure to these forms remained at a rudimentary level, it became evident that Master Jonan's waning energy prevented him from delving deeper into their intricacies.

And so they realized that their training with Master Jonan's was soon coming to an end.
