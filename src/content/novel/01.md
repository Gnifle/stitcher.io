You feel the heat closing in. That lukewarm glow on your face slowly transforms into a hot burning radiation. It's the fifth spell flying towards you, and this time you wonder whether it's better to give in. 

It won't be painful — probably. It'll be quick — probably. It means the end of your journey, and you don't think that's a bad thing. Some people might blame you, but you trust most will applaud you for your efforts — even though you failed. That is, of course, if there still are people able to applaud.

You're still holding your staff, so you _can_ still fight. You know the drill: catch the spell, channel its energy and combine it with yours, throw it back at him — or them, you're not sure anymore — and _hope_ it will be the final blow. Otherwise, the dance repeats, ultimately until one of you is worn out.

In the end, it's a simple decision: fight, or give in. The irony is that neither choices end well for you, but only one of choice _might_ lead to less suffering overall, for other people, that is.

Time to decide, there it comes.
