It won't take much longer now, you'll rest soon. Don't fight it, it's ok to give in. Whatever feelings you're feeling, they will fade. 

The heat closing in? Don't try to flee from it. Let it embrace you like a warm blanket. Don't catch it.

Yes, your hands are burning, but once you let go, it'll be over. No more pain.

Close your eyes. Surrender to the inevitable. It'll soon be over.
