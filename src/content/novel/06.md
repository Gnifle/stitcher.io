They walked through their village with tears in their eyes, hoping those eyes were deceiving them.

The slow, steady blaze of houses on fire was weirdly comforting. As if the fire itself was saying "you can accept it now, there's nothing more to gain nor loose."

At a distance, the village had seemed empty, though now that they made their way into the abandoned streets, they discovered bodies of fallen swordsman here and there, clearly outnumbered by whatever struck them. Slowly they made their way unto the town square. Their hope of finding any survivors diminishing with each step. They heard the distant sound of a roof collapsing. 

Overwhelmed by a sense of defeat, they halted in the middle of the square. June sobbed quietly. Tom kept turning around, still in disbelief. Adrian stood frozen. 

Tom was the first to speak â€” whisper, actually. "We should," his words chocked. "We should gather the dead." 

Adrian nodded. June didn't reply.

"Let's do one more sweep of the southern part then," Adrian said, as he turned around and walked away. Tom and June followed in silence.

As they made their way into the southern streets, Adrian suddenly stopped. He turned around.

"Maybe you shouldn't," he said, his face darkened in the little evening light there was.

Tom and June looked at him in confusion for a moment. It was June who noticed first. In the darkness of the alley in front of them, she could make out the vague contours of a body. It took her a moment before she noted the oak staff laying besides it, broken in two.

As Tom moved besides June to look at what was going on, June fell to her knees, she cried and screamed at the sky. 

Whatever energy Tom still had, left his body when he realised. There lay
