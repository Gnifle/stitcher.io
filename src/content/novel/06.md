They walked through the village with tears in their eyes, hoping those eyes were deceiving them.

The slow, steady blazing houses were weirdly comforting. As if the fire itself was saying "you can accept it now, there's nothing more to gain or lose."

At a distance, the village had seemed abandoned, though now that they made their way into the streets, they discovered bodies of fallen swordsmen here and there. They were clearly outnumbered by whatever struck them. They walked slowly as they made their way to the town square. Their hope of finding any survivors diminished with each step. In the distance, a roof collapsed, sending a cloud of embers high into the sky.

Overwhelmed by a sense of defeat, they halted in the middle of the square. June sobbed quietly. Tom kept turning around, still in disbelief. Adrian stood frozen.

Tom was the first to speak — whisper, actually. "We should," his words choked. "We should gather the dead."

Adrian nodded. June didn't reply.

"We don't know how many are still alive," Adrian said, trying to present some hope.

"If anyone's still alive," Tom replied, "then I'm not sure if they are better off."

They worked in somber silence as they gathered bodies from the streets and carried them to the town's square. As the day progressed, so did the amount of bodies. Twelve in total now. Some unrecognizable, their face broken and mangled; others known, some even friends.

"I think we're almost done," Adrian said, as they took a moment of pause, overlooking the dead.

"Only the most southern part of the village still, I think," Tom replied. The surrounding fire had been slowly fading, and the sun was almost setting. The sky was dark with ash and smoke.

"Let's do one more sweep of the southern part then," Adrian said, as he turned around and walked away. Tom and June followed in silence.

As they made their way into the southern streets, Adrian suddenly stopped. He turned around.

"Maybe you shouldn't," he said, his face darkened in the little evening light there was.

Tom and June looked at him in confusion for a moment. It was June who noticed first. In the darkness of the alley in front of them, she could make out the vague contours of a body. It took another moment before she noticed the oak staff laying beside it, broken in two.

As Tom moved beside June to look at what was going on, June fell to her knees, she cried and let out a loud scream. Now Tom saw it as well: the body of Master Jonan, two arrows in his chest, one of his hands still gripping the broken part of his staff, his blank eyes staring into nothingness.

—

Both spellcasters held their staff in front of them and closed their eyes. They kept their staff close until they felt enough energy had built up. As if someone was signaling them, they opened their eyes simultaneously, drew their staff behind them, then slung it with a throwing motion forward. A ball of energy hurtled towards the lined up bodies. On impact, the pile immediately caught fire. All three of them stood in silence, too tired for crying, as the newly lit fire blazed in front of them.

After about 15 minutes, Adrian broke the silence. “We should set up camp outside the village.”

Tom and June didn’t reply.

“Let’s go,” he said, laying his hand on Tom’s shoulder. “We need to rest.”

It took another hour before they had found a good camping spot and could set up their tents. Soon, they fell into a dark slumber with vague dreams and distant cries.

“Wake up”, a voice said. June heard it, but slipped back into slumber. “Wake up!”, the voice repeated. June opened her eyes, a chill down her spine as she saw Master Jonan in front of her. His blank eyes looked straight at her.

“Wake up!” June startled, opening her eyes a second time. She woke up from her dream, with Adrian in front of her.

“There you are.” He said, with a faint smile. “You were dreaming, I think.”

“I was,” June replied, as she was scanning her surroundings. It was a dream.

“Is it morning already?” She asked, only half awake.

“It is,” Tom replied, as he was sitting at the campfire, preparing breakfast.

Last night, they set up camp at the top of a hill close to the village. June had been so tired that she had slept a good part of the morning. The sun was already shining bright when she woke up. It would have been a picturesque morning, were it not for last night’s trauma, engraved in their minds.

“Come,” Adrian said as he held out his hand to June, “we need to talk.”

They gathered around the campfire, and Adrian continued.

“I’ve been thinking all throughout the night. The most likely scenario is that an elven raid passed through our village. My guess is that the sound we heard on our way to the White Woods was them en route.”

Adrian sighed.

“We probably passed them on their way back as well, when we ran into their scouting party.”

“On their way back…” Tom repeated, “with prisoners.”

“That could be, but we cannot be sure of that.” Adrian intervened. “We shouldn’t draw early conclusions.”

“My parents are with them,” June whispered silently.

“We’re not sure of that, June”. Adrian intervened once again. “Let’s think this through. Let’s assume our people were taken prisoners by elves. If we passed them on their way back yesterday morning, that would mean they are already in the northern parts of the White Woods by now, far out of our reach.”

“So we’re giving up on them?” June shouted as she interrupted Adrian.

“No, I’m not. What I’m saying is that we cannot chase them on our own. If they were taken prisoner, we’ll need to set up a rescue party; and to do that, we’ll have to travel to Arduina.”

“Now, let’s consider the alternative,” Adrian continued, “our people might have fled the scene long before they were in any danger. We’re still not sure what these elves set out to do, so our people might simply be on the run.”

“Where would they go?” Tom asked.

“Arduina seems the most likely.” Adrian replied.

“So, whatever we do,” Tom replied,

“It’s best to mount and travel to Arduina as soon as possible, either we find our people along the way, or we reach Arduina to set up a rescue party.” Adrian completed Tom’s sentence.
