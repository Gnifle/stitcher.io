They walked through their town with tears in their eyes, still hoping those eyes were deceiving them.

The slow, steady blaze of houses on fire was weirdly comforting. As if the fire itself was saying "just accept it, there's nothing more to gain nor loose."

At a distance, the village had seemed empty, though now that they had made their way into the abandoned streets, they discovered bodies of fallen swordsman here and there, clearly outnumbered by whatever struck them. But no sign of civilians.

Slowly they made their way unto the town square. Their hope of finding any survivors diminishing with each step. Somewhere in the distance they could hear the roof of a house collapsing. 

With a sense of defeat, they halted in the middle of the square. June sobbed quietly. Tom kept turning around, still in disbelief. Adrian stood frozen. 

Tom was the first to speak. "We should," his words chocked. "We should gather the dead." 

Adrian nodded. June didn't reply.

"We don't know how many are still alive," Adrian mentioned, trying to present a spark of hope; if not for Tom and June, then for himself.

"If anyone's still alive," Tom replied, "then I'm not sure if they are better off." Levelling Adrian's spark of hope to the ground.
