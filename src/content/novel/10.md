"Wake up," Adrian said, "it's time."

Tom slowly woke, feeling tired after a short night's sleep — he had been awake most of the night, mulling about what would happen today. He finally fell asleep two hours ago, and here was Adrian waking him already. Nothing he could do about it now.

"Is it raining?" He asked, his senses still waking up, only now being aware of the trickling sound on the roof.

"Yeah, it started an hour or so ago."

"Too bad," Tom replied, trying to rub the sleep out of his eyes.

"No worries, General Oraa thinks it will play to our advantage." Adrian noted.

"You've already seen him?" Tom asked. 

"Yes, many are already gathered, I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer, but I really had to wake you by now. Let's get ready."

After a quick bite, Tom and Adrian left their house, mounted their horses and rode them slowly through the empty streets of Arduina. Everyone who couldn't fight moved out yesterday, retreating to settlements further south, outside the city's wall. Tom and Adrian rode to the other side though, to the northern gate. 

The Arduinian army was gathering.

In silence, they rode, only the sound of hooves clopping on the cobblestone road. It only lasted a minute — the silence — because soon Tom became aware of the busy sound of an army preparing in the distance: metal clanking, swords being sharpened, horses walking all around, people quietly talking, with the occasional order shouted above all the other noise. 

Tom was to meet with the spellcaster's division led by Master Onu, Adrian would report to the archer division. When they passed the gate, they said their goodbyes.

"See you soon," Adrian said confidently.

"Good luck," Tom replied, as he turned his horse the other way, and rode towards the spellcaster's tent. 

The Arduinian army was a sight to behold. Last night, many more troops from surrounding towns had arrived — towns who pledged their loyalty to each other. There were near 500 swordsmen, 200 archers, and around 150 horsemen. Everyone had settled in over the nights, and the fields in front of the northern wall were dotted with grey tents. 200 meters in front of the wall, there was a line forming. 

As Arduina lay on a hill, Tom overlooked the battlefield from above. The continuous gentle downpour was slowly transforming the bottom of the hill — near the front line — into a soggy ditch. This is probably what General Oraa meant: the rain was working in their favor, constructing a natural barricade for the elven army to overcome.

When Tom arrived at the spellcaster tent, he was happy to see June already being there. Just like the army, she was a sight to behold as well. She wore Arduina's official spellcaster garment: a purple tunic with a golden embroidered leave — the emblem of Arduina. Above that, a hooded woolen cape, clamped together with a golden button. Her black hair knotted and her staff on her back. 

Indeed. She was a sight to behold.

"Tom, right on time," Master Onu greeted him. "Let's get you suited up, we're still waiting for Mari, and then we can start."

Tom got the same garments as June, although he didn't look quite a fancy as she did. 

Mari arrived a couple of minutes later. When everyone was dressed in battle garment, Master Onu gathered everyone. "Spellcasters, let me lay out the plan for you," he said, addressing the five spellcasters.

The first volley of arrows flew silently through the air. These were warning shots, not intended to do any harm. The elves at the other side of the field didn't seem to care. Their line kept slowly advancing. This first elven division counted around 100 horsemen and 500 swordsmen. Elves weren't tactical masterminds when it came to large-scale battles, but they had advantage in numbers.

As their line came into shooting range, they sped up their pace. Soon though, they hit the ditch where rain had been collecting for the past hours, and visibly slowed down. The next volley flew. More than a handful of elves were struck and fell, but their line recovered quickly, and they continued their march. Again, they picked up speed now that they cleared the valley's lowest point.

Tom stood with the other spellcasters on their lookout hill, 100 meters behind the Arduinian line, watching how both armies would collide soon. He had a splendid view of the battle taking shape, but only felt frustration that he'd had to wait. As master Onu had instructed, he looked out for potential spellcaster threats within the elven lines. There was nothing to be seen, yet. 

The elven line closed in, and Arduina's swordsmen prepared for impact. Archers fell back, making room for the swordsmen, and shifted their focus on elven riders now. The collision was weirdly silent. Tom expected for people to scream more. There were screams, but most soldiers only groaned. Death was weirdly quiet.

Both lines suffered losses, but Arduina's army was clearly in better shape. Their archers had managed to dismount already half of the elven riders, and elven soldiers were falling left and right. Now there were screams. Arduinian intimidating shouts carried over the battlefield. The human army felt invigorated at their initial success.

From the woods at the edge of the field, a new elven line emerged. This one seemed smaller, but also more compact. It wasn't as much a line as it was a block.

Master Onu's gaze shifted immediately.

"That's a spellcaster division," he said calmly. "We wait until they've revealed themselves."

More waiting. Tom almost couldn't anymore. But he did. He was a soldier now, following command.

The block slowly advanced, way slower than the first elven line. It counted no more than 100 elves. 

Suddenly, a burst of energy emerged from the group, which had split apart at exactly the right moment. A huge spell flew towards the front line and hit. It hit elves and humans alike, but there were more human casualties, by far. A second spell was cast shortly after.

"Let's ride!" Master Onu commanded, "Tom, June, and Mari to the left; Sirian, Hari, and me to the right."

The group split, riding their horses to either edge of the front line. They would attack the block from both sides. As Tom, June, and Mari rode towards the left edge of the line, ten shielded horsemen joined them to offer protection. These men had one task: making sure Ardiunian spellcasters reached their goal. As they reached the corner, all spellcasters held their staves, guiding their horses with one hand. 

They turned around the line, and galloped towards the elven block in the center. A spell flew in their direction, cast somewhere within the depths of the block. June caught it without any hesitation, and made it dissipate into thin air in an instant. 

Suddenly, Tom realised he had no idea how they'd reach the center of the block; it was still protected by many elven warriors. Right when Tom was wondering what he'd do, a new close-range volley was launched, right at the block. Several elven warriors fell, and suddenly the elven spellcasters were exposed. Immediately, they unleashed a volley of spells themselves, directed towards to front line. Five or six spells caused a huge explosion, causing dead men and elves, and random body parts, to be thrown in the air.

Mari was the first one to start to counteroffensive. "Let's cast!" She proclaimed, and threw her spell towards the elves. Tom and June followed shortly after, just in time to notice Master Onu, Sirian, and Hari to have reached to other side.

The elven spellcasters were trapped.

However, _they_ didn't seem to mind as they formed a circle and cast spells in unison. They were able to all work together and their spells were formidably powerful. 

The first one of these unison spells hit Tom, June and Mari. They weren't able to catch and neutralize it in full, though they did manage to lessen its impact. On that impact, all three riders were thrown off their horses. 

It's a weird sensation, Tom realised, as he was being thrown through the air. It couldn't have taken more than 2 seconds, but it felt like 20 seconds at least. Tom and his fellow spellcasters were agile though, they had trained for this. Tom remembered the lessons with Duke, the stable master, and instinctively put his hands forward, transitioning his fall into a perfect roll.

"Textbook," he said, smiling to himself.

"Watch out!" June cried as she ran towards Tom and caught a spell flying towards his back. 

Tom suddenly realised he was facing the wrong way. Immediately, he turned around, just in time to catch another spell. 

"Thanks!" He shouted at June, who was now standing beside him.

"Thank me later," she replied as she caught yet another spell. 

The elven spellcasters were now casting unison spells per two, and focussing on one or two Arduinian spellcasters at once.

"June, we can do the same!" Tom yelled. "Mari, come over here!"

Mari stood a couple of meters away from them when she shouted "I'm rather occupied at the moment," right when she caught a huge spell flying towards her. 

"Then we come to you!" Step by step, Tom and June made their way towards Mari, continuing to catch spells that kept flying towards them. 

"We should unison cast," Tom said when they reached her. 

"I don't think we have time for that," Mari replied.

"Can you cover us?" June interjected.

"I'll try!" she replied.

Tom and June positioned themselves behind Mari, who now served as a human spell-shield. She did an amazing job. Meanwhile, Tom and June concentrated on the surrounding energy. It was awfully difficult to focus on casting spells in the middle of the battlefield, and both Tom and June laid their lives in the hands of Mari and their protective horsemen at this point.

They closed their eyes for a moment, once they felt that familiar sensation throughout their hands and staves, they elevated their staves in unison, feeling the energy of their combined spell surging throughout their bodies. As if rehearsed — which they surely hadn't — they threw their unified ball of energy forward. 

Initially, Tom feared it would be unstable and explode before it reached its target, but soon the ball picked up speed and covered the distance between them and their adversaries — 50 meters or more — in just a couple of seconds. Tom and June watched it fly, surprised with themselves that they had cast it.

The elven spellcasters shared their surprise. They were able to catch the spell, but it still exploded and significantly rattled them. For just a moment, the elven spellcasters stood in astonishment for its power, but it didn't take long for one of them to shout some commands, and they were back at spellcasting.

At this point, the elves clearly had an advantage, all being together compared to the Arduinian spellcasters split in two separate groups. 

"We should try to reach the other side!" Mari proclaimed.

She gestured one of the horseman to plan their route. As the horseman turned, one of the elven spellcasters saw his chance, and shot a quick spell towards him. This spell wasn't all that powerful — a spellcaster could have caught it with ease — but that didn't apply for others.

The horseman fell to the ground, his face completely charred from the spell's impact, dead. In shock at the sudden death, Mari turned back to the enemy line and threw several channeling spells in quick succession. 

"Mari!" Tom shouted, "Give us cover!"

Mari turned to look at Tom, recovered and wanted to focus on her task, when an arrow shot straight past Tom, and hit one of the elven spellcasters right in the chest. He fell. Tom turned around to see one of the riders lowering his bow.

One down. Tom nodded at the rider, then focused back on the group in front.

Meanwhile, at the other side, Onu, Sirian, and Hari had copied Tom's tactic: Sirian was providing cover, while Onu and Hari cast unison spells. Onu was definitely the most experienced spellcaster of them all, so their unison spells were even more powerful than Tom and June's. The elves were able to fend them off; but, for now, it seemed like the Arduinians were finally taking the offensive.

Soon, Tom and June, Onu and Hari turned their seemingly disadvantage of being split, into a strength. They found a rhythm: Tom and June cast their spell, forcing the elven spellcasters to focus on neutralizing it. Only moments later, Onu and Hari threw theirs, bringing the group out of balance. When they went back to casting, Mari and Sirian fended off the cross fire. 

Suddenly, Onu and Hari's spell hit their target right where they wanted. Three elven spellcasters fell. Only three more to go. They had a clear advantage now.

It was too early to rejoice though, as suddenly one of the three remaining elves — the assumed commander — unleashed a spell in Onu and Hari's direction. 

Tom watched from a distance, with a mix of awe and shock. He had never seen a spell like it: a continuous stream of energy — not a ball — where did this spellcaster draw energy from?

Tom witnessed Hari fall to the ground from a distance, then the spellcaster moved to his next target. Onu managed to fend off the beam, splitting it in two — but by doing so, one of the split streams of energy hit Sirian. He fell.

The spellcaster stopped. Tom, June, and Mari stood perplexed. Tom's eyes crossed Onu's, he only saw panic.

"Watch out!" Master Onu cried from afar, stretching one hand towards Tom, as if he wanted to pull Tom away from the danger.

Too late, Tom realised the spellcaster had only stopped to turn around, and was already casting his beaming spell. Tom could feel the heat closing in. At first, a lukewarm glow on his face, next a hot burning radiation, next nothing.
