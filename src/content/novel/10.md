"Wake up," Adrian said, "it's time."

Tom slowly woke, feeling tired after a short night's sleep — he had been awake most of the night, mulling about what would happen today. He finally fell asleep two hours ago, and here was Adrian waking him already. Nothing he could do about it now.

"Is it raining?" He asked, his senses still waking up, only now being aware of the trickling sound on the roof.

"Yeah, it started an hour or so ago."

"Too bad," Tom replied, trying to rub the sleep out of his eyes.

"No worries, general Oraa think it might play to our advantage." Adrian noted.

"You've already seen him?" Tom asked. 

"Yes, many are already gathered, I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer, but I really had to wake you by now."

After a quick bite, Tom and Adrian left their house, mounted their horses and rode them slowly through the empty streets of Arduina. Everyone who couldn't fight moved out yesterday, retreating to settlements further south, outside the city's wall. Tom and Adrian rode to the northern gate though. Arduina's army was gathering.

In silence, they rode, only the sound of hooves clopping on the cobblestone road. It only lasted a couple of minutes though — the silence — because soon Tom became aware of the busy sound of an army preparing in the distance: metal clanking, swords being sharpened, horses walking all around, people quietly talking, with the occasional order shouted above all the other noise. 

Tom was to meet with the spellcaster's division led by Master Oku, Adrian would report to an archer division. So when they passed the gate, they said their goodbyes.

"See you soon," Adrian said confidently.

"Good luck," Tom replied, less confident, as he turned his horse the other way, and rode towards the spellcaster's tent. 

Arduina's army was a sight to behold. It only was last night that many more troops from surrounding towns arrived, all who pledged their loyalty to each other. They knew that, if this front didn't hold, all villages would probably undergo the same fate as Bugswood. This was their last defence.

When Tom arrived at the tent, he was happy to see June as ready as could be. She was a sight to behold, wearing Arduina's official spellcaster's garment: a purple tunic with a golden embroidered oak leave — the symbol of Arduina. Above that a hooded woolen cape, clamped together with a golden leaved button. Her ginger hair knotted and her staff on her back. 

Indeed. She was a sight to behold.

"Tom, right on time," Master Onu greeted him. "Let's get you suited up, and then meet our spellcaster's division."

Tom got the same garments as June, although he didn't look quite a fancy as she did. 

"People, we're still waiting for two spellcasters to join, but they probably won't arrive before noon. So let me lay out the plan for you," Master Onu gathered the five spellcasters around the table in the middle of the tent.

"We've sent out "

---

The first volley of arrows flew silently through the air. These were warning shots, not intended to do any harm. The elves at the other side of the field didn't seem to care. Their line kept slowly advancing. This first elven division counted around 100 horsemen and 500 swordsmen. Elves weren't tactical masterminds when it came to large-scale battles, but they had advantage in numbers.

As their line came into shooting range, they sped up their pace. At the same time, the next volley flew. A handful of elves were struck and fell, but the majority kept up the pace.

Tom stood with the other spellcasters on their lookout hill, watching how both lines would collide soon. He had a splendid view of the battle taking shape, but only felt frustration that he'd had to wait. As master Onu had instructed, he looked out for potential spellcaster threats within the elven lines. Nothing to be seen, for now. 

The elven line closed in, and Arduina's footmen prepared for impact. Archers shifted their focus on riders, them being the biggest thread. The collision was weirdly silent. Tom expected for people to scream more. There were screams, but most soldiers only groaned. Death was weirdly quiet.

Both lines suffered losses, but Arduina's army was clearly in better shape. Their archers had managed to dismount already half of the elven riders, and elven soldiers were falling left and right. Now there were screams. Arduinian intimidating shouts carried over the battlefield. The human army felt invigorated at their initial success.

From the woods at the edge of the field, a new elven line emerged. This one seemed smaller, but also more compact. It wasn't as much a line as it was a block.

Master Onu's gaze shifted immediately.

"That's a spellcaster division," he said calmly. "We wait until they've revealed themselves."

More waiting. Tom almost couldn't anymore. But he did. He was a soldier now, following command.

The block slowly advanced, way slower than the first elven line. It counted no more than 100 elves. 

Suddenly, a burst of energy emerged from the group, which had split apart at exactly the right moment. A huge spell flew towards the front line and hit. It hit elves and humans alike, but there were more human casualties, by far. A second spell was cast shortly after.

"Let's ride!" Master Onu commanded, "Tom, June, and Mari to the left; Sirian, Hari, and me to the right."

The group split, riding their horses to either edge of the front line. They would attack the block from both sides. As Tom, June, and Mari rode towards the left edge of the line, ten shielded horsemen joined them to offer protection. These men had one task: making sure Ardiunian spellcasters reached their goal. As they reached the corner, all spellcasters held their staves, guiding their horses with one hand. 

They turned around the line, and galloped towards the elven block in the center. A spell flew in their direction, cast somewhere within the depths of the block. June caught it without any hesitation, and made it dissipate into thin air in an instant. 

Suddenly, Tom realised he had no idea how they'd reach the center of the block; it was still protected by many elven warriors. Right when Tom was wondering what he'd do, a new close-range volley was launched, right at the block. Several elven warriors fell, and suddenly the elven spellcasters were exposed. Immediately, they unleashed a volley of spells themselves, directed towards to front line. Five or six spells caused a huge explosion, causing dead men and elves, and random body parts, to be thrown in the air.

Mari was the first one to start to counteroffensive. "Let's cast!" She proclaimed, and threw her spell towards the elves. Tom and June followed shortly after, just in time to notice Master Onu, Sirian, and Hari to have reached to other side.

The elven spellcasters were trapped.

However, _they_ didn't seem to mind as they formed a circle and cast spells in unison. They were able to all work together and their spells were formidably powerful. 

The first one of these unison spells hit Tom, June and Mari. They weren't able to catch and neutralize it in full, though they did manage to lessen its impact. On that impact, all three riders were thrown off their horses. 

It's a weird sensation, Tom realised, as he was being thrown through the air. It couldn't have taken more than 2 seconds, but it felt like 20 seconds at least. Tom and his fellow spellcasters were agile though, they had trained for this. Tom remembered the lessons with Duke, the stable master, and instinctively put his hands forward, transitioning his fall into a perfect roll.

"Textbook," he said, smiling to himself.

"Watch out!" June cried as she ran towards Tom and caught a spell flying towards his back. 

Tom suddenly realised he was facing the wrong way. Immediately, he turned around, just in time to catch another spell. 

"Thanks!" He shouted at June, who was now standing beside him.

"Thank me later," she replied as she caught yet another spell. 

The elven spellcasters were now casting unison spells per two, and focussing on one or two Arduinian spellcasters at once.

"June, we can do the same!" Tom yelled. "Mari, come over here!"

Mari stood a couple of meters away from them when she shouted "I'm rather occupied at the moment," right when she caught a huge spell flying towards her. 

"Then we come to you!" Step by step, Tom and June made their way towards Mari, continuing to catch spells that kept flying towards them. 

"We should unison cast," Tom said when they reached her. 

"I don't think we have time for that," Mari replied.

"Can you cover us?" June interjected.

"I'll try!" she replied.

Tom and June positioned themselves behind Mari, who now served as a human spell-shield. She did an amazing job. Meanwhile, Tom and June concentrated on the energy field around them. It was awfully difficult to stay focussed on casting spells in the middle of the battlefield, and both Tom and June literally laid their lives in the hands of Mari and their protective horseman at this point.

They closed their eyes for a moment, once they felt that familiar sensation throughout their hands and staves, they elevated their staves in unison, feeling the energy of their combined spell surging throughout their bodies. As if rehearsed — which they surely hadn't — they threw their unified ball of energy forward. 

Initially, Tom feared it would be unstable and explode before it reached its target, but soon the ball picked up speed and covered the distance between them and their adversaries — 50 meters or more — in just a couple of seconds. Tom and June watched it fly, surprised with themselves that they had cast it.

The elven spellcasters also didn't expect such a powerful spell to be thrown at them: they were able to catch it, but it still exploded and significantly rattled them. For just a moment, the elven spellcasters stood in astonishment for its power, but it didn't take long for one of them to shout some commands, and they were back at spellcasting.

At this point, the elves clearly had an advantage, all being together compared to the Arduinian spellcasters split in two separate groups. 

"We should try to reach the other side!" Mari proclaimed.

She gestured one of the horseman to plan their route. As the horseman turned, one of the elven spellcasters saw his chance, and shot a quick spell towards him. This spell wasn't all that powerful — a spellcaster could have caught it with ease — but that didn't apply for others.

The horseman fell to the ground, his face completely charred from the spell's impact, dead. In shock at the sudden death, Mari turned back to the enemy line and threw several channeling spells in quick succession. 

"Mari!" Tom shouted, "Give us cover!"

Mari turned to look at Tom, she had good intentions, but they failed. She was just about to focus on covering again, when an arrow shot straight past Tom, and hit one of the elven spellcasters right in the chest. He fell. Tom turned around to see one of the riders lowering his bow.

One down. Tom nodded, then focused back on the group in front.

Meanwhile, at the other side, Onu, Sirian, and Hari had copied Tom's tactic: Sirian was providing cover, while Onu and Hari cast unison spells. Onu was definitely the most experienced spellcaster of them all, so their unison spells were even more powerful than Tom and June's. The elves were able to fend them off; but, for now, it seemed like the Arduinians were finally taking the offensive.
