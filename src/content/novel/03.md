"Follow the river northward, and it will guide you to the entrance of the White Woods," instructed Master Jonan. "A two-day journey on horseback will take you to the forest's edge, and from there, you will trek a couple of hours on foot to venture deeper into its depths. Leave your horses at the forest's edge, for the overgrown paths within are unsuitable for them."

June and Tom stood before Master Jonan, absorbing his words. This was their final task of their five-year training under his guidance. They would head into the White Woods. Not all the way towards the center, they would only travel to the border between human and elven lands.

Master Jonan reassured them: "you don't need to worry about encountering any elves along your path. They never come this close to our lands, they haven't done so for decades."

"Nevertheless," he continued, "I shall assign Adrian as your guide. He is well-known with the White Woods and has traversed it on numerous occasions. He knows how to navigate through them and lead you safely to your goal."

Their objective lay in finding the Southern Shrine, the closest one to their village, situated on the southern fringes of the White Woods. While their training under Master Jonan had encompassed a wealth of knowledge in advanced spellcasting topics, one crucial item with still missing: a spellcaster's staff.

"A spellcaster's staff can be as humble as a branch from a tree," Master Jonan had imparted, "but its true power lies in the binding spell that intertwines the essence of the spellcaster with their staff. This bond makes it an indispensable tool, and will open new ways of spellcasting for both of you."

June and Tom had spent countless hours practicing their binding spell in preparation for this very moment. Their staves had already been crafted from sturdy birchwood sourced from the village's surrounding woods. Each staff was adorned with intricate, curled engravings that had been burnt into the wood. At the bottom of the staves, metal tips were affixed to protect them from damage while traveling. Ropes were attached to both ends, allowing June and Tom to secure their staves on their backs when riding.

Master Jonan had shared tales of grand spellcaster staves, imbued with an assortment of precious gems and crafted from exotic tropical woods. "Perhaps one day you will create staves as splendid and powerful as those. However, do not be deceived by appearances. While some embellishments and gems serve a purpose, many spellcasters tend to overindulge in ornamentation without adding any practical value."

Master Jonan's current staff, a simple oak one, stood much taller than both June's and Tom's staves, reaching above his head. Despite its unassuming appearance, it was a potent and formidable tool.

"Off you go," declared Master Jonan. "I wish you the best of luck on your journey. Stay safe."

With those words, June and Tom mounted their horses and embarked on their quest, Adrian by their side.

They traced the winding path of the river, just as Master Jonan had advised. Adrian led their way with a determined stride. It was early spring, and the landscape was slowly coming alive again. The birch trees with their new leaves stood in solitude against the vast expanse of green fields.

After a couple of hours of travel, the familiar clusters of trees faded into the distance, leaving their village far behind. The river was still flowing to their right. Recent rains up north had caused the water to rise, and the water seemed full of energy. They made steady progress throughout the day.

As the sun began to set, it cast a golden glow over the land. They decided it was time to make camp for the night. They sought shelter beneath the branches of a lone tree, only a short distance from the river's edge. The world around them grew hushed as darkness crept in.

"We're quite exposed out here," Adrian remarked, scanning their surroundings. "Let's hope the weather remains kind to us tonight. Tom, you'll handle setting up the tents, and June, get a fire ready. We might need to use some of the dry firewood we brought along, as the wood from this tree appears too damp to ignite properly."

June couldn't help but be amused by Adrian's oversight regarding their spellcasting abilities, but she simply nodded and smiled in agreement.

"I'll scout the area a bit more and see if I can catch some fish for dinner," Adrian continued. "I'll return within the hour." With those words, he embarked on his solitary journey towards the river.

June wasted no time. She gathered twigs and selected a few sturdy lower branches from the generous oak tree that served as their campsite centerpiece. Armed with the axe borrowed from Adrian's backpack, she skillfully reached the tree's lowest branches. Once an ample pile of wood was collected, June stepped back, took a deep breath, and began casting her spell. She released it towards the awaiting fire pit, where it struck the wood with a resounding hiss, causing water droplets to evaporate in its wake.

For a brief moment, not much seemed to happen aside from the gentle hissing and the faint glow of the scattered spell fragments nestled between the twigs and branches. Then, without warning, a powerful rush of air filled the space, accompanied by a deep, resounding whoosh. In an instant, a magnificent fire blazed to life, casting a warm glow that danced and flickered in the growing darkness.

"Of course, you get the easy task!" Tom's voice rang out from a distance as he struggled with setting up the first tent.

June couldn't help but beam with satisfaction. "Oh, poor Tom. Need a hand?"

"Yes, please," Tom sighed, his shoulders slumping in defeat. Adrian's tents proved to be a formidable opponent for a self-proclaimed mighty spellcaster like Tom.

The next morning unveiled a beautiful sunrise, casting a gentle orange glow upon the horizon. Yet, the biting chill of a westward wind swept across the camp, ruffling their hair and sending a shiver down their spines. It carried with it the unmistakable touch of winter remnants.

Adrian, ever diligent, had already set about preparing breakfast as June stirred from her slumber. Tom emerged shortly after, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.

"I'm concerned," Adrian spoke softly as they gathered around the crackling campfire. June and Tom exchanged curious glances. "Hush," Adrian gestured, urging them to listen intently.

“What exactly are we hushing for?” Tom asked. “Hush” Adrian now said out loud. “Listen.”

A distant sound carried on the wind, like the low rumble of thunder yet distinct in its rhythm and synchronicity. It was subtle, yet clearly present.

"What is that?" June voiced the question that lingered on their minds.

Adrian, his voice barely a whisper, replied, "I'm not certain. It could be a herd of Muskox, although they seldom venture south of the woods."

"Where does it come from?" Tom inquired, his eyes scanning the surrounding landscape.

"To the west, several kilometers away. The wind carries its echo," Adrian answered, his gaze fixed on the unseen source. "It would be wise to proceed swiftly, whatever it may be."

"But breakfast?" Tom's main concern was evident in his voice.

Adrian's response was pragmatic. "You can eat while we ride. Let's not waste any time. If that sound is coming towards us, we want to get going as soon as possible. Whatever it is."

Efficiently, they dismantled their tents under Adrian's adept guidance. Belongings were secured to their saddles, and with the sun climbing higher in the sky, they mounted their horses, commencing the second leg of their journey.

The terrain gradually shifted, evolving from the open grass plains into undulating hills adorned with unruly vegetation. The rhythmic thumping sound faded into the distance as they continued following the restless river, now wider and more turbulent. Its banks transformed from serene sandbars to rocky precipices, where the horses maneuvered the slow ascent. Eventually, the river veered into a deep ravine, snaking its way beneath them several meters below. The once serene and meandering waters now surged and churned, cascading with wild abandon.

As evening approached, a sight emerged seemingly out of thin air — towering trees, a majestic veil that beckoned them forward. Shadows danced beneath the barren forest canopy. The air turned cooler, saturated with the earthy musk that permeated the White Woods. Nature itself seemed to hush, as if the forest held its breath in anticipation of their arrival. There was only the never-ending sound of the rushing river.

“We’ll camp here,” Adrian said as he ordered his horse to a standstill. “Tomorrow morning, we’ll make our way towards the Shrine, while the horses stay here.”

They dismounted, their eyes widening in awe as they beheld the forest that loomed before them. It was a sight to behold, unlike anything they had ever encountered. The slender birch trees of their village were but mere saplings compared to the colossal oaks that now stood as sentinels of the White Woods.

The towering giants stretched high above their heads, their bare branches reaching out like gnarled fingers towards the heavens. Still, sunlight managed to make its way through the foliage, casting dappled patterns of light upon the forest floor. Patches of delicate Snowdrop flowers bloomed, their pristine white petals a stark contrast against the earthy colors of the woodland. It was no wonder that the forest had earned its name—"White Woods."

After a hearty meal, exhaustion settled upon the weary travelers like a heavy blanket. The strain of two days of relentless riding had taken its toll, leaving them yearning for respite. As the night deepened, they fell into a deep sleep. Even Adrian, their ever-vigilant guide, found solace in the realm of dreams.

A gentle rain started to fall. They slept so deep that no one heard the sound of rhythmic thunder in the far distance.
