June woke from a deep sleep, it was early morning still. The sound of rain trickling on the room would have sufficed to put her to sleep again, were it not for the sudden thought that crossed her mind: today's the day.

In an instant, she was wide awake. Today's the day.

She rose, got dressed, and went to the dining room. Adrian was already awake â€” had he slept at all?

"Morning," he said with a faint smile, "early rising?"

"I guess so," June replied as she grabbed a couple loaves of bread. "I could say the same of you."

"Oh I've slept enough; besides, I'm expected to join general Oraa's morning brief in half an hour. You can join, if you want to."

June was amazed when the first volley flew through the air. Despite it falling short a couple dozens of meters, it was impressing to see hundreds of arrows fired in rapid succession. The elven line didn't seem impressed by it though, as they slowly kept advancing.
